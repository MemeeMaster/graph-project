2. (optional) import database by yourself using "graph_project.sql" in phpMyAdmin
3. Drop project files to your XAMPP htdocs folder.
4. Open project in your IDE and type commands:

	- php artisan serve

5. Open project in your browser by clicking link in your console
6. Project should be working correctly!

**Note:** My experience with Laravel is minimal. 
I actually learned it while creating this project.
Other than that, the project works nicely!
